<p>As students with .edu email addresses, there are fortunately many things that we're allowed to have for free. The best deals that I've been able to find are listed below.</p>
<h3><a href="https://education.github.com/pack/" target="_blank">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the best deal available to us as student developers. My personal favorites in here are the AWS, DigitalOcean, GitHub, and Namecheap credit, but I have used other offers in this pack for various purposes throughout the last few years. The things offered here vary greatly and are all very useful, opening up many new opportunities for you with these powerful tools, provided by GitHub.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/" target="_blank">JetBrains Tools</a></h3>
<p>I can't vouch for most of these, but I trust JetBrains as a company and can definitely at least vouch for IntelliJ, which is my go-to IDE for when I'm writing Java. The offer is extended to their other IDEs as well, giving you environments to work in for PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Objective-C, and more.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured" target="_blank">Autodesk Software</a></h3>
<p>Modelling is something that I've never really gotten into, but AutoCAD is a recognized name throughout the industry, and you really can't go wrong with these tools if you need them. If you need to model something whether it's for your next project with 3D graphics, or maybe for 3D printing, Autodesk is the way to go.</p>
