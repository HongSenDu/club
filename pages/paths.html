<p>"Paths" is our term for different technologies that our club members can work with. Currently we have resources available for web design, mobile development and data science, but we are always looking to add more. Although we only have resources available for these three, they are just suggestions; members of Bronx Science Hackers are free to work with whatever they wish.</p>
