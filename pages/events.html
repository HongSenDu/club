<p>From time to time, we will be organizing events for members of Bronx Science Hackers. These may be workshops, talks, or field trips, for example. We're always looking to organize more, and club members who attend more meetings will have priority if we hit a limit on the number of people that can attend. Although events will be posted here, they will all be emailed out to club members as well.</p>
