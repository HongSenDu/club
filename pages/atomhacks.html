<p>AtomHacks is Bronx Science's annual 12-hour hackathon. Once a year, students of all skill levels come together to create something involving technology, competing for the grand prize. In previous years, students have won iPad Minis, 3D printers, Particle Maker kits, Amazon gift cards, and more.</p>
